## **⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow in AWS SageMaker**
1. **🛠 Build**
2. **🧪 Test & Tune**
3. **🚀 Deploy**

---

### **1️⃣ Build**
- Provides **15+ pre-built ML algorithms** for training  
- Collect and prepare training data, or choose from **Amazon S3**  
- Select and optimize algorithms such as:  
  - 📊 K-Means  
  - 📈 Linear Regression  
  - 📉 Logistic Regression  
- Customize ML instances using the **Jupyter Notebook** interface  

---

### **2️⃣ Test & Tune**
- Set up and manage the training environment  
- Train and tune models using **hyperparameter optimization**  
- Data storage: **Amazon S3**  
- Training code storage: **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**  
- SageMaker provisions clusters, trains models, and stores results in **S3**  

---

### **3️⃣ Deploy**
- Deploy tuned models to **SageMaker Endpoints** for **real-time predictions**  
- Evaluate performance to check if business goals are achieved

## **📂 How to Train a Model with AWS SageMaker**

### **Requirements**
- 🔗 URL of Amazon S3 bucket with **training data**  
- 🖥 ML compute instances  
- 🔗 URL of Amazon S3 bucket for **output storage**  
- 📍 AWS ECR path for **training code**  

### **Process**
1. **Create a Training Job** in SageMaker  
2. **Fetch Input Data** from the specified S3 bucket  
3. **Launch ML Compute Instances**  
4. Train the model with the dataset and training code  
5. Store **output & artifacts** in Amazon S3  
6. Use **helper code** to handle training failures  
7. Inference code processes **prediction requests**  
8. **ECR** stores and manages container images  
9. Save trained data to avoid loss in critical processes
