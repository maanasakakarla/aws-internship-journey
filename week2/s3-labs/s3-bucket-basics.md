# S3 Bucket Basics - Hands-on Lab

## Objective
Create an AWS S3 bucket, upload files, and explore basic bucket settings.

## Steps Performed

1. Logged into AWS Console and navigated to the S3 service.

2. Created a new bucket named `maanasa-internship-demo` in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region.

3. Uploaded sample files: `example.txt` and `image.png`.

4. Checked the bucket permissions:
   - Default is private.
   - No public access granted.

5. Explored bucket properties:
   - Versioning: Disabled.
   - Encryption: Not configured.
   - Tags: None added.

## Key Learnings

- S3 buckets require globally unique names.
- Buckets are private by default to ensure data security.
- Files inside buckets are called “objects.”
- You can upload multiple files and manage them through the console or CLI.

## Reflections

This exercise helped me understand the basics of S3 buckets, how data is stored, and the default security posture of AWS S3.
